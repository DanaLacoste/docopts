NAME
        docopts - interpreter for docopt, the CLI description language

SYNOPSIS
        docopts [<arg>]...

DESCRIPTION
        Docopts reads from standard input a command line interface description
        written in the docopt language and uses it to parse the given arguments.
        The results of this parsing are stored as files in a temporary directory
        (created with mkdtemp(3)), named after the arguments whose values they
        capture.  On successful execution, the path to this directory is printed
        to standard output; if there are problems with either the interface
        description or the arguments, docopts exits with status 1 and prints a
        diagnostic message to standard error.  Note that this directory must
        be manually deleted by the user when no longer necessary.
        
        Different types of command line arguments map to file contents as
        follows:
        
        *   Flags and commands: An empty file if present, no file if not.
        *   Counted flags and commands: The number of their instances in the
            argument vector.
        *   Arguments and options with arguments: The value of the argument if
            present, no file if not.
        *   Repeatable arguments and options with arguments: A subdirectory
            containing a file for each instance of the argument, labeled from
            1 onwards.
        
        The files contain no trailing newlines.
        
        If specified in the interface description, the following options trigger
        special behavior if encountered during parsing:
        
        *   --help or -h: Docopts prints the interface description to standard
            error and exits with status 2.
        *   --version: If the interface description supplied to docopts contains
            a form feed character (U+000C), the text after the form feed is
            considered the version message.  Docopts prints it to standard error
            and exits with status 2.
        
        If your shell interpreter supports terminating a script upon a
        subcommand returning a non-zero exit status, this behavior enables
        clean termination of scripts with --help and --version options.

ENVIRONMENT
        POSIXLY_CORRECT
            If set, all parameters after the first non-option parameter are
            likewise interpreted as non-option parameters when parsing the
            arguments.

EXAMPLE
        #!/bin/sh -e
        ### Usage: foo [options] repeatable-command... <repeatable-argument>...
        ### 
        ### Options:
        ###   -o ARG  Option with argument.
        ###   --help  Help flag.
        
        trap cleanup EXIT
        
        cleanup() {
            rm -rf $args 2>/dev/null
        }
        
        args=$(grep "^### " "$0" | cut -c 5- | POSIXLY_CORRECT= docopts "$@")
        
        if [ -e $args/-o ]; then
            echo "Option given with argument $(cat $args/-o)."
        fi
        
        echo "Repeatable command input $(cat $args/repeatable-command) times."
        echo "Repeatable arguments:"
        
        for i in $(ls $args/\<repeatable-argument\>); do
            # recall that the files have no trailing newlines, so a plain
            # `cat` would not do
            echo "$(cat $args/\<repeatable-argument\>/$i)"
        done

VERSIONING
        The docopts version number always matches that of the docopt Python
        reference implementation version against which it was built.  As
        docopt follows semantic versioning, docopts should work with any
        docopt release it shares the major version number with; however, as
        both docopts and docopt are in major version number 0 at the moment,
        docopts can only be relied to work with an installation of docopt
        with the exact same version number.
