docopts
=======
Docopts is a shell interpreter for the docopt command line interface description
language, designed to simplify the task of argument parsing in shell scripts.

Installation
------------
Execute the following command in the release directory to install docopts for
all users::

    python setup.py install

If you only wish to install docopts for yourself, use::

    python setup.py install --user

Running docopts
---------------
Docopts reads a command line interface description from standard input and uses
it to parse the arguments passed to it.  If successful, the parsed arguments
are stored in a temporary directory and its location is written to standard
output.  Docopts is commonly invoked as follows:

    args=$(echo "$help" | docopts "$@")

For details, see the man page.
